# DisplayingAPointCloudUsingSceneDepth

This repository distributes the Point Cloud sample code that Apple released at WWDC2020, with the addition of the smoothedSceneDepth feature.

The smoothedSceneDepth feature currently only works on the iPad Pro (5th generation), but in the future it will also work on iPhones equipped with LiDAR.
